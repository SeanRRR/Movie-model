# Kylan, Reed, and Sean's Github for the GDG Mini-ML Competition

## Description
This repository contains various Python files related to our model.

### Our repository contains an additional file
- `EmptyRow.py' - which deleted any empty rows.

### Please note:
The three of us have hardly used Github before, so we struggled with the interface and resorted to some Google Docs copy-and-pasting throughout our process. Nonetheless, we enjoyed the opportunity to participate in this competition.
